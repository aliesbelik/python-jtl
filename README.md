> Python module for parsing JMeter test results

**NOTE:** [Original](https://code.google.com/p/python-jtl/) repository [imported by author here](https://code.google.com/archive/p/python-jtl/).

[python-jtl](https://code.google.com/p/python-jtl/) provides a module called **jtl** which can be useful for parsing JMeter
results (so called JTL files). JTL files can be either of XML or CSV (with or without the fieldnames) file format. **jtl** module supports both XML and CSV (with and without the fieldnames) file formats.

The typical usage in general looks like this:

    from jtl import create_parser

    parser = create_parser('test_results.xml')
    for sample in parser.itersamples():
        ...

## Features

- Parses JMeter results (JTL) into the iterator of the results samples;
- Supports both XML and CSV (with and without fieldnames) file formats;
- Supports custom delimiter character (CSV only);
- Stores results samples in named tuples;
- Uses iterative XML parsing for better performance;
- Automatically detects the file format (XML or CSV).
